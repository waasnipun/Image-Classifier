# Image Classifier
This is a small project done using tensorflow and python with HTML for classifying images and identifying what that imagen is about.
The dataset Used i used is from tensorflow cifar10 and it contains 10 different classes and 60000 images(50000 for training and 10000 for testing).
The model I trained is saved and then it used again in order to test new images.
Model had 85% of accuracy for trained data and 70% of accuracy for testing data.
I trained the model for 35 epochs and can improve the accuracy by increasing number of epochs.
To create the neural network I used API keras and it did the work pretty well.
All the codes and the trained model can be found in  this repo with the tutorials I used for my guidance.
